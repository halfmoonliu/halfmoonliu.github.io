      <description>&lt;p&gt;Machine learning (ML) can be applied for medical decision support in clinical settings. In this post, I demonstrated the workflow of training ML models for pediatric pneumonia patient risk evaluation using randomly generated electronic health records (EHRs). I started with data cleansing and exploratory analysis on physician-identified biological indices, such as pathogens, lab data and vital signs. The goal train model to classify patients into 2 groups: high-risk patients with the need for intensive care and low-risk patients. Various ML models, such as logistic regression, boosted trees and feedforward neural networks were applied for the classification task. The workflow was applied on real-world EHRs at National Taiwan University Hospital and achieved an AuROC of 0.99. The detailed methodologies and results were published in JMIR Medical Informatics (Liu et al., 2022).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
