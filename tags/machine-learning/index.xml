      <title>Predict Future Number of Taxi Transactions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Accurate prediction of future number of taxi transactions enables hailing companies to allocate drivers, design incentives and set prices accordingly. Exploratory analysis on taxi transaction records in New York City from 2015 to 2021 were conducted and temporal regularities were found. Hourly numbers of transactions in 8 taxi zones in December 2019 were used to test the performance of different algorithms. Random forest regression outperformed other algorithms (time series models, long-short term memory) and reached root mean squared error (RMSE) of 9.6, reducing nearly 80% of RMSE of the baseline model of exponential smoothing. Slides and code for this project can be found on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Use BiLSTM for Name Entity Recognition</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Name Entity Recognition (NER) is a natural language processing task for categorizing words into name entities with numerous applications (e.g., searching, text classification, etc.). The following is a demo on how I trained a Bi-directional Long-Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) model to predict name entities with an accuracy of over .95 using the CoNLL-2003 Dataset.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Evaluate Intensive Care Needs with ML</title>
      <link>https://halfmoonliu.github.io/posts/evaluate-intensive-care-needs-with-ml/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Machine learning (ML) can be used by hospitals to improve the quality of healthcare. The purpose of this post is to demonstrate the steps necessary to build ML models that evaluate the need for intensive care within the first 24 hours of hospital admission. This post includes the workflow process of data cleansing, feature engineering, and model building, which can be applied directly to real-world settings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
