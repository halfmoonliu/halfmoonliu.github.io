      <description>&lt;p&gt;Name Entity Recognition (NER) is a natural language processing task to categorize words into name entities, which has many applications (e.g. searching). Here I is a demo of how I trained a bi-Directional Long-Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) model to predict name entities with accuracy of over .95 using CONRLL 2003 dataset.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Machine learning (ML) can be applied in hospital to improve health care quality. This is a demonstration of steps to build ML models to evaluate the need for intensive care within the first 24 hours of admission. The post includes the workflow from data cleansing, feature engineering and model building that can be direcly applied in real-world settings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
