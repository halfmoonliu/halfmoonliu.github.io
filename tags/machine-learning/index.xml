      <description>&lt;p&gt;Name Entity Recognition (NER) is a natural language processing task to categorize words into name entities, which has many applications (e.g. searching). Here is a demo of how I trained a bi-Directional Long-Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) model to predict name entities with accuracy of over .95 using CONLL 2003 dataset.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Machine learning (ML) can be used by hospitals to improve the quality of healthcare. The purpose of this post is to demonstrate the steps necessary to build ML models that evaluate the need for intensive care within the first 24 hours of hospital admission. This post includes the workflow process of data cleansing, feature engineering, and model building, which can be applied directly to real-world settings.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
