      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of the most recent breakthroughs in machine translation is the application of the transformer. Compared with the sequence-to-sequence model based on recurrent neural networks(RNN), the attention-based transformer model makes use of token-wise information which further enhances the machine translation results. In this post, I will walk through a project of comparing the performances and structure of RNN- and transformer-based and machine translation models. Please have a look!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
