      <p>Machine learning (ML) can be applied in hospital to improve health care quality. This is a demonstration of steps to build ML models to evaluate the need for intensive care within the first 24 hours of admission. The post includes the workflow from data cleansing, feature engineering and model building that can be direcly applied in real-world settings.</p>
<h2 id="quick-summary">Quick Summary <a href="#quick-summary" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Computer-aided evaluation of patients severity can improve health care quality in hospitals. This <a href="https://github.com/halfmoonliu/PredictDiseaseICUAdmission" target="_blank" rel="noopener">project</a> demonstates the workflow of building ML models to evaluate the need for intensive care within first day of admission using randomly generated Electronic Health Records(EHRs). A quick project walkthrough slide can be found <a href="https://github.com/halfmoonliu/PredictDiseaseICUAdmission/blob/main/ProjectWalkThrough_Predict%20The%20Need%20For%20ICU%20Admission%20of%20Patients%20With%20SpecificDisease.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Below are details of key steps of the workflow.</p>
<h2 id="step-1-create-dataset">Step 1: Create Dataset <a href="#step-1-create-dataset" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>To demostrate the workflow, randomly generated EHRs were used. Items related to creating a disease specific severity evaluation model, such as sex, age, diagnosis code, vital signs, lab exams&hellip;etc were included. The generated data imitates the format of real-world EHRs extracted from health information systems.</p>
<h2 id="step-2-select-cohort-with-specific-disease">Step 2: Select Cohort with Specific Disease <a href="#step-2-select-cohort-with-specific-disease" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>Since the condition of patients with different diseases can be reflected on different physical indices, the first step of building a alarm system is to select a cohort for model building. Here, we select the cohort by thier ICD (International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems) code.        <br>
ICD code are detail classification of existing diseases that evloves through time. Thus, multiple ICD codes can be grouped as one disease. For example, the ICD code 485 (brochopenumonia, organism unspecified) and 486 (pneumonia, organism unspecified) can both be considered pneumonia related codes. As time goes, new versions of ICD will replace the older version.485, 486 are codes from ICD-9; the corresponding codes in ICD-10 are J18.0(Bronchopneumonia, unspecified organism), J18.8(Other pneumonia, unspecified organism), and J18.9(Pneumonia, unspecified organism). As one can notice by glancing the codes, similar diseases have similar ICD codes. In ICD-10, codes begining with J1 are all pneumonia or respiratory tract infection related diseases; codes that begin with J18 are different kinds of pneumonia, unspecified organism.</p>
<h2 id="step-3-data-preprocessing-and-feature-engineering">Step 3: Data Preprocessing and Feature Engineering <a href="#step-3-data-preprocessing-and-feature-engineering" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p><strong>a. Cormorbid condition</strong>:          <br>
Cormorbid conditions can have huge impact on prornosis. For example, pneumonia patients with cardiovascular diseases are of higher risk of ICU admission. Thus, we can group diagnosis code to a numbers of cormorbid conditions (i.e. if a patient has any of the diagsnosis code A, B or C, he/she is considered having Cormorbid Condition 1). In the demo, five cormorbid condtions were put into the model as features (with/without the cormorbid condtion).     <br>
<strong>b. Pathogen:</strong><br>
For infectious disease, pathogens are related to the evaluation of severity. For example, bacterial pneumonia tends to be more severe in children than viral pneumonia. In this demo, regular expression was used to extract positive pathogen exam findings and add the finding to ML model as one feature (with/ without positive findings of the pathogen).<br>
<strong>c. Lab data:</strong> <br>
Various biochemical test conducted in labs can reveal patient&rsquo;s general body function (e.g. white blood cell count, C-Reactive Protein&hellip;etc). To evaluate the need for intensive care of inpatient on the first day, initial records of lab data were included as features for machine learning models.<br>
<strong>d. Vital signs:</strong>     <br>
Vital signs such as temperature, pulse or blood pressure are important indicators patient condition. In this demo, maximum temperature, pulse, minimum systolic and diastolic pressure recorded within the first day of admission was included as features in the model to predict ICU admission.</p>
<h2 id="step-4-model-selection-and-hyperparameter-tuning">Step 4: Model Selection and Hyperparameter Tuning: <a href="#step-4-model-selection-and-hyperparameter-tuning" class="anchor">üîó</a></h2><p>In an outcome prediction task where few features are of fine temporal resolution, tres-based methods, such as XGboost and random forest, can yield good performances. In these models, maximum depth of trees, learning rate and regularization are some of the hyperparameters that can further enehance model prediction power. ML models can outperform existing indicies or severity score that clinician used nowadays, which come from previous studies using logistic regression models. In the demo, six machine learning models were chosen for the prediction task: Boosted Trees, Random Forest, Feedforward Neural Network, Logistic Regreesion, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).</p>
